- declaration - definition - initialization - statement - prototype - assignment

- object refers to a storage in memory in which values can be stored.
- names of identifiers can be assigned to objects
- the name or identifier bound (bind) to an object is called variable
- values can be assigned to identifiers (names or variables) which altogether produces a variable  
- variable: a named location in memory where data can be stroed

- for the sake of best practices, naming in C and C++ should avoid using _ or __ for the beginning of the name as this is the convention for
system level (implementation) naming

- garbage value

- fundamental types - complex types

- rhs -> right hand side
- lhs -> left hand side
- lvalue - rvalue

- narrowing conversion

- header file -> a file with declaration of tools (libraries)
#include<iostream> -> tell the preprocessor to include the iostream header file so that the compiler does not produce error

- division by 0 gives runtime error
- division by 0.0 gives inf or NaN if the system follows IEEE754 standard

- implementation-defined behavior

- compound assignment operators
- all assignment operators return assigned value

- linker is a software program whose job is to combine object files obtained from compiler into a single executable file
- linker error
- naming conflict
- namespace -> a container which allow grouping identifiers (variables, funcitons, classes, etc.) under a unique name to avoid
naming conflict

- integral value
- integral constant
- switch label

- fallthrough behavior
- [[fallthrough]] attribute -> C++17

- dereference operator (indirection operator)

- reference -> alias

- a reference cannot be changed once initialized
- re-assigning a reference with a new value, does not change what the reference refers to, it changes the value it refers to

- call by value
- call by reference using pointers
- call by reference using references

- same category type

- function overload resolution:
1. exact match
2. type promotion
3. type conversion
4. user-defined type conversion
5. ellipsis conversion

- #include <string>

- It is best practice to always write the prototypes of functions in header files. But we may choose to define small functinos, it
is better to define those functions as inline to avoid liker error
