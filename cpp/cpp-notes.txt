- declaration - definition - initialization - statement - prototype - assignment

- object refers to a storage in memory in which values can be stored.
- names of identifiers can be assigned to objects
- the name or identifier bound (bind) to an object is called variable
- values can be assigned to identifiers (names or variables) which altogether produces a variable  
- variable: a named location in memory where data can be stroed

- for the sake of best practices, naming in C and C++ should avoid using _ or __ for the beginning of the name as this is the convention for
system level (implementation) naming

- garbage value

- fundamental types - complex types

- rhs -> right hand side
- lhs -> left hand side
- lvalue - rvalue

- narrowing conversion

- header file -> a file with declaration of tools (libraries)
#include<iostream> -> tell the preprocessor to include the iostream header file so that the compiler does not produce error

- division by 0 gives runtime error
- division by 0.0 gives inf or NaN if the system follows IEEE754 standard

- implementation-defined behavior

- compound assignment operators
- all assignment operators return assigned value

- linker is a software program whose job is to combine object files obtained from compiler into a single executable file
- linker error
- naming conflict
- namespace -> a container which allow grouping identifiers (variables, funcitons, classes, etc.) under a unique name to avoid
naming conflict

- integral value
- integral constant
- switch label

- fallthrough behavior
- [[fallthrough]] attribute -> C++17
