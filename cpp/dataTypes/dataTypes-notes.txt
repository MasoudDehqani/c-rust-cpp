Fundamental data types:
- int
- char
- bool
- float
- double
- void

User-defined data types:
- class
- enum
- struct
- union

Derived data types:
- arrays
- pointers
- references
- functions

type specifiers for int:
- short int
- int
- long int
- long long int
- unsigned short int
- unsigned int
- unsigned long int

data types conversion:
- implicit
- explicit

- Data types in an expression must be consistent for the compiler to be able to compile
- automatic (implicit) type conversion will be done by the compiler to make all types consistent and same
- lower data type to higher data type to avoid data loss

- lower VS higher data types -> size/range - precision
- type peomotion hierarchy

explicit type conversion:
- named casts
- cast notation
- function notation

- cast notation and function notation type conversion is discouraged in modern C++ dut to lack of safety and readability

- auto type specifier -> introduced in C++11 -> deducing the type by compiler based on initializer -> like type inference in other languages
- auto type specifier is used quite frequently in STL and templates

- decltype type specifier -> introduced in C++11
- decltype type specifier is used quite frequently in STL and templates -> generally for complex types
