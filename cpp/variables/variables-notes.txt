- declaration - definition - initialization - statement - prototype - assignment

- object refers to a storage in memory in which values can be stored.
- names of identifiers can be assigned to objects
- the name or identifier bound (bind) to an object is called variable
- values can be assigned to identifiers (names or variables) which altogether produces a variable  
- variable: a named location in memory where data can be stroed

definition:
dataType variableName;

Through definition, we:
- declare the properties of a variable
- requesting a block of memory

properties of a variable:
- type of the data of the variable (size of the variable)
- name of the variable

declaring a variable:
extern char grade;
telling the compiler that the variable is already defined somewhere in the project and we are not defined
it here. we are going to only use it here.

- for the sake of best practices, naming in C and C++ should avoid using _ or __ for the beginning of the name as this is the convention for
system level (implementation) naming

- garbage value

- fundamental types - complex types

- default initialization - copy initialization - direct initialization - list initialization - value initialization

- list initialization -> modern -> does not allow narrowing initialization

- copy initialization
- rhs -> right hand side
- lhs -> left hand side
- lvalue - rvalue

- narrowing conversion

int age = 30.5; -> no compile error -> narrowing conversion
