named constants
literal constants

named constants -> constant variables - macros - enumerated constants

const dataType CONSTANT_NAME; -> recommended
dataType const CONSTANT_NAME;

- constant variables must be initialized;

macros:
- object-like macros
- function-like macros
- more...

- A macro is a name which preprocessor replaces with a value or a code before compilation
- preprocessor replaces a macro with the actual definition

#include
#define

- macros are disregarded in modern C++
- macros -> global scope -> entire program
- macros are handled by the preprocessor, not the compiler
- hard to debug

alternatives:
- inline functions
- constant variables
