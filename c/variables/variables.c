/*
 
- Generally, in variable definition, we can say a value is bound to a name
- variables simply are names that point to a memory location

- declaration -> announcing properties of variable to the compiler
- definition -> allocating memory for a variable
- properties of variable -> name and size
- size is specified by type

- variable modifiers

- These are possible in C, but not in Rust:
int var1, var2, var3;
var1 = var2 = var3 = 10;
int x = 1, y = 2, z = 3;

- These are possible in Rust, but not in C:
let x = 1;
let x = 2;
(this is called shadowing in Rust)

- In C, starting variable names with _ is valid, but not recommended. Because huge number of variables starting with _ are reserved for
system use
- initialization -> assigning a value to variable
