/*
  - Parsing has a long, rich history in computer science that is closely tied to the
  artificial intelligence community. Many of the techniques used today to parse programming
  languages were originally conceived to parse human languages by AI researchers who were
  trying to get computers to talk to us

  - scanning - lexing - lexical analysis - scanner - lexer - token
  - parsing - grammar - parser - parse tree - abstract syntax tree (AST) - syntax tree - syntax error
  - static analysis - binding - resolution - identifier - scope - type error - attributes -
  symbol table
  - everything up to this point is considered the font end of the implementation
  - middle end and back end remains
  - intermediate representation (IR)
  - optimization - constant folding
  - code generation -> back end
