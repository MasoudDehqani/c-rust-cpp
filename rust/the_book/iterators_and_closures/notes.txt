virtual dispatch - dynamic dispatch - static dispatch
type erasure
virtual calls
full inlining
compile type optimization across layers
iterators are lazy streams
terminal operation
pipelines of state machines
adapter

iterator struct
no mutation

execution model
layers are not container, they are behavior
each iterator adapter is a state machine with logic, not storage
nothing is extracted, it is constructed
consumer
the type collapse is not unwrapping. it is execution
Iterator adapters compose behavior.
Iterator consumers execute behavior.
a chain of functions waiting to run
