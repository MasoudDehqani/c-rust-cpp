there is a set of items in the standard library Rust brings them into the
scope of every program. this set is called prelude

- if you need something in the standard library which isn't in prelude,
you should bring it into the scope via 'use' keyword
- io (input/output) library comes from standard library (std)

- the 'main' function is the entry point to every Rust program

- binding a name (variable or identifier) to a value using 'let' keyword
and '=' sign (maybe can be called assignment operator as in C)
- immutable by default
- mut keyword for making it mutable

- comment syntax include: // -> for one line and /* */ -> for multiline
- associated function
- std::io::stdin
- the stdin function return an instance of std::io::Stdin type

- single logical line of code
- we call each possible state of an enumeration (enum), a variant
- read_line method, if successful, returns Ok of the numbers of bytes
in the users's input

- the set of curly brackets inside the format string in println! macro is
called placeholder

- println!("{}", expression);
- println!("{:?}", expression);
- println!("{:#?}", expression);
- println!("{expression:?}");
- println!("{expression:#?}");
- println!("{0}, {1}", expression1, expression2);

- binary crate -> executable
- library crate -> intended to use by others, cannot be executed on its own

- semantic versioning (SemVer)

- registry -> a copy of data from crates.io ???
- updating the registry ???

- reproducible builds with cargo.lock
- cargo.lock file somehow locks the versions of dependencies
- the project remains at versions indicated at cargo.lock until explicitly
upgraded
- the command 'cargo update' will ignore the cargo.lock and upgrade versions
- cargo follows SemVer semantic versioning
- for example specifying 0.8.5 for a crate (which is a shorthand for ^0.8.5)
and then run 'cargo update' will upgrade the package to a version higher than
0.8.5 but below 0.9.0
- to upgrade the package to 0.9.x series, the cargo.toml file should be
changed and the version of the package in the [dependencies] section should
be changed

- projects can be assembled from a number of packages

- being local to the current thread of execution ???

- 'cargo doc --open' command will build documentation provided by all the
project's dependencies locally and open it into browser

- a match expression is made up of arms
- an arm consists of a pattern to match against

- on windows pressing Enter return a carriage return and a newline (\r\n)
- catch-all -> _ in match expressions
