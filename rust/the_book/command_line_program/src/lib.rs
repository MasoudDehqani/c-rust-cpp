    - without using 'static lifetime specifier in the build function's signature, the compiler
    does not know where to borrow the &str (which is a borrowed type). There is no string related
    type in the params of the function and there is only a &str in the return type. So, when there is
    no related type in params, it will be defined in the function itself and by the end of the
    function execution, all defined variables will be deallocated. So, the compiler does not know
    where to borrow the &str in return type. By specifying 'static lifetime specifier, the compiler
    is informed that the string literal value would be in the binary which is available for the
    entire life of the program. In general, string literals are global and live forever. The 'static
    lifetime specifier also has the exact meaning

    - using 'mut' before the parameter, does not mean that the caller has to pass a mutable arg.
    it means, inside the function body, the binding named args can be mutated.
    - in Rust, mutability is not part of the type, it is part of the binding
