- What consume an interator
map method
for loop

- both iterators and futures are lazy. They do nothing unless you explicitly ask them to do

- async code needs a runtime
- a program's main function can initialize a runtime but it is not a runtime itself
- deferrent runtimes have different bahavior based on OS, hardware, etc.

- unrolling a for loop means create manual code for each loop iteration. it is a performance optimization can be done by compilers

- while let conditional loop

- polling

- concurrency VS parallelism
- core is in hardware. having multiple cores means having multiple cpu units
- process is in software handling by OS
- OS manages multiple processes at once.
- thread is in a process and can be handled by the program inside a process
- many operating systems provide API with which programming languages can call to create new threads. Rust standard library
implemented 1:1 model of multi-threading in which 1 OS thread is used per 1 language thread

- concurrency means doing multiple tasks by one entity by switching between tasks multiple times
- parrallelism means breaking a task or tasks into multiple parts and doing the tasks simultaneously
- threads can be both execute their tasks both concurrency and simultaneously

- mutex -> mutual exclusive
- lock - unlock
- shared memory

- race condition -> threads access data or resource in an inconsistent order
- deadlock -> two threads are waiting for each other, preventing both threads from continuting
