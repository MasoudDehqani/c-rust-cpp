        As in Rust a value can only have one owenership at a time, here the owenership of
        s1 moves to s2 and then s2 is being used. Here move occurs because String does not
        implement Copy trait. Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being
        called a shallow copy, it’s known as a move.
        A value of type String, stores this info of the String on the stack:
        the address of pointer, length, capacity
        But integer type implement Copy trait and when we bind int1 to int2, it is copied
        and not moved, so the code compiles successfully.
        As String type has no fixed size and not known at compile time and can grow later,
        it is stored on heap not stack.
        There are many situations in a program that more than one piece of code need to
        use a value.
