/*
    - ownership
    - move
    - safety is the absence of undefined behavior
    - pointer
    - all programming languages have the concept of pointer, they only differ in how
    - Rust goal: include as few runtime check as possible in its output binary programs
    - a foundational goal of Rust is to ensure your program never have undefined behavior
    - a secondary goal of Rust is to prevent undefined behavior at compile time instead of runtime
    - to compile programs into efficient binaries that require as few runtime checks as possible
    they expose it to the programmers
    - ownership as a discipline for memory safety
    - Rust provides a particular way to think about memory
    - stack frame
    - reference is a type of pointer
    - borrowing
    - variables live in the stack
    - boxes live in the heap
    - Rust does not allow manual memory management (does no allow manual deallocation)
    - But what are Drop trait and std::mem::drop method???
    - deallocation - freeing - dropping
    - focusing on frame-only variables is for better understanding of safety in Rust, but in fact
    compiler may put the variable in the register instead of stack frame. it is the implementation
    details and should not affect the understanding of the concept of safety in Rust
    - only types that implement Copy trait can be copied implicitly
    - copying all kinds of value can be expensive
    - Rust uses pointer to access data without copying
    - pointer - pointee
    - owned pointer -> example: Box
    - non-owned pointer -> reference
    - references change variables' permissions
    - borrow checker
    - a value should outlive all of its references
    - lifetime of a value is from its definition to its last usage
    - memory management
    - heap management
    - pointer management
    - manual memory management

    - ownership at first introduced in a paper for something completely other than safety
    it is introduced for the issue of leakage of internals of some data structures
    then the concept used for memory safety in Rust

    - when a program tries to read a value and expects it to be boolean and since the value
    does not exist due to an invalid memory access, it would be an undefined behavior. the
    address program tries to access could be anything which in not known at all

    - heap data is not tied to a specific stack frame
    - one common way to make a pointer is to allocate memory in the heap

        As in Rust a value can only have one ownership at a time, here the ownership of
        s1 moves to s2 and then s2 is being used. Here move occurs because String does not
        implement Copy trait. Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being
        called a shallow copy, it’s known as a move.
        A value of type String, stores this info of the String on the stack:
        the address of pointer, length, capacity
        But integer type implement Copy trait and when we bind int1 to int2, it is copied
        and not moved, so the code compiles successfully.
        As String type has no fixed size and not known at compile time and can grow later,
        it is stored on heap not stack.
        There are many situations in a program that more than one piece of code need to
        use a value.
