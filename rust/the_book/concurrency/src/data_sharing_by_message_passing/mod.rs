/*
  Here’s the idea in a slogan from the Go language documentation:
  “Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.”

  - channel
  - Rust standard library provides an implementation of channels
  - a channel has two halves -> a transmitter and a receiver
  - a channel is said to be closed if either the transmitter or the receiver half
  is dropped

  - mpsc -> multiple producers, single consumer
  - Rust standard library's implementation of channel is of type mpsc
  - note that there can be multiple transmitter but only one receiver on each
  channel
  - but there is no limit for that one receiver to call the recv() method since the
  method use only a reference to the receiver. there is also no limit for iterating
  over that one receiver, provided that the ownership of the receiver is not moved.
