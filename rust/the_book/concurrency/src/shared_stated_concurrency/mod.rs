/*
  It seems MutexGuard which is the Ok() side of the Result type of lock() method return type
  on Mutex is a smart pointer and can be dereferenced using * operator

  - multiple ownership methods with Rc<T> and Arc<T>
  - Rc<T> -> a reference counted smart pointer (for using in single-threaded contexts)
  - Arc<T> -> atomically reference-counted (for using in multi-threaded contexts)
  - Arc<T> is thread-safe, means that it can safely used in multi-threaded contexts
  - thread safety comes with a performance penalty that you only want to pay when you really need to
  - Atomics are an additional kind of concurrency primitive
  - atomics work like primitive types but are safe to share across threads

  - counter is immutable, but we could get a mutable reference to value inside it; this means
  Mutex provides interior mutability as the Cell family does
  - Mutex<T> comes with the risk of creating deadlocks

  TODO: try creating a Rust program that has a deadlock; then research deadlock mitigation strategies for
  mutexes in any language and have a go at implementing them in Rust. The standard library API
  documentation for Mutex<T> and MutexGuard offers useful information

  TODO: read more about Sync and Send traits and how concurrency can be extensible in Rust

  - using Arc::clone will only increment the reference count, and it doesn't make a deep copy of
  all the data like most types' implementations of clone do

  Note that if you are doing simple numerical operations, there are types simpler than Mutex<T> types provided
  by the std::sync::atomic module of the standard library. These types provide safe, concurrent, atomic access
  to primitive types. We chose to use Mutex<T> with a primitive type for this example so we could concentrate
  on how Mutex<T> works

  STEP 2

  Here in this code, even with the use of "move" keyword for the closure passing to the spawn, the compiler
  throws an error saying that the counter "moved into closure here, in previous iteration of loop".
  Here we used move correctly, so the counter ownership is moved into the closure, but creating multiple
  threads in the loop requires multiple ownerships of the counter Mutex. So we need to use a tool which
  make it possible.
