- building VS compiling

Expressions in Rust categorized as:
- place expressions -> may occur either in place context or value context
- value expressions -> may occur either in place context or value context
* historically place expressions were called lvalues and value expressions were called rvalues
* there is also a third minor category called assignee expressions

- static has a single memory location. You can take a reference of it. So it behaves as a standard variable. const exists only as
a value. It can be copied or inlined in places where it is used by the compiler

const does not define a variable with a value stored at a "place", it defines a value. See:
